The reviewer below is absolutely right about the Playin'. Intense, surging, yet melodic, this jam is classic Europe '72. While this Playin' is short, it is essential Dead. \nThe Truckin>Drums>Other One segment also contains some neat improvisation. The 23-minute Other One contains more melodic jamming than your typical '72 version, plus there is some space after the 2nd verse, though no transition is made (Wharf Rat could have easily segued out of it). Despite the lackluster recording quality, slow speed, and tedious between-song chatter, this show is worth picking up, especially for Other One fans.","reviewtitle":"Once you get past the","reviewer":"phleshy","reviewdate":"2005-02-20 20:16:08","stars":"4"},{"review_id":"27470","reviewbody":"OMG! This Playin absolutely BLAZES! I was doing a sound check on the show and I downloaded the Playin. This Playin is as aggressive as it gets. There is NO other band that jams this hard and this good. This Playin is a step further than most other jams. Bottom line: I need to own this Playin. Ergo, so do you. \n   The Other One also rages. After the bass driven opening, the Dead jam HARD for about 2 minutes. It doesn't matter how many times I hear this type of jam from The Dead: I always get goose bumps as I pay homage to their shear mastery of their instruments as well as to their ingenuity and inventiveness of jam. There really was nothing like a Grateful Dead concert. All ya gotta do is listen and you'll have an epiphany as to just how good these guys were. This entire year is jam after jam of raging Grateful Dead. I suggest you own it all.","reviewtitle":"The Main Ten!!","reviewer":"bootleg43","reviewdate":"2005-08-10 10:18:10","stars":"5"},{"review_id":"50511","reviewbody":"I think you have to be truly deadicated to get past the mediocre sound quality. But having said that the playing is amazing as previous reviews claim. Europe '72 run must have been a blast for the band if the consistent quality of performance is any indicator. The added weight of being Pigpen's last hurrah make these shows extra special. I admit I get distracted by a poor quality recording and would not recommend this to newcomers. Try Rotterdam 5\/11 & London 5\/26.

It's ALL so F'n good!\n\nThe tape this recording is from obviously suffered from drag (over successive generations) that slowed down the original tempo of the music.    I recall many bootlegs over the years having issues with being either too fast or too slow compared w\/what was played originally.      BUT, despite those defects in the recordings, it just added another dimension to the sound of the bootleg that endeared me (at least) to them---this one is no different.    I actually enjoy that this recording is a tad slow.     The power of what they were doing is still backed up inspite of the flaw.    \nThe banter after Black-throated Wind (played w\/aplomb) is quite funny.     Truckin>TOO is typically good, as it would be for the entirety of 1972---'72 is my fav year for The Other One.","reviewtitle":"more magic from Europe in 1972","reviewer":"tree-ap","reviewdate":"2008-11-05 19:21:15"},{"reviewbody":"I believe Loser and Black Throated Wind are from the soundcheck.

'You vill do it zis vay!' The Grateful Dead follow the rules? Good fucking luck, dudes!\"  Rock Scully\n\nPerhaps the weakest performance of the European tour. Not particularly well played and the sound quality is somewhat problematic. Still, the short Playin' in the Band is a decent performance while The 23 minute Other One has its moments and contains a couple of interesting passages, the most compelling of which are a brief melodic jam immediately after the intro and a particularly intense Garcia solo starting around the 13 minute mark.

As such, it was live but there was no audience. Robert Hunter commented on this show in the rhino edition of Europe '72;  Hunter noticed that the room felt stiff and cold.  \"I realized that what they needed was people dancing, but there was only me,\" he says, \"so I piled onto the floor and danced my proverbial ass off, the music picked right up.\"\n\nI have only sampled the sound a little on this as of yet.
