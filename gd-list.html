There was no encore, they never left the stage before One More Saturday Night. Pigpen played organ only, didn't sing or play harp. This was recorded from Box 52 which is just left of center. Recorded with a Sony Cassette recorder with Shure Microphone attached. This recording was transferred directly to digital using Audacity. There is about a 5 second drop out on \"the Other One\", it happened as the original recording was being made. Also a couple of slightly muffled spots from audience obstructions and/or tape degrading, but not too bad for an audience tape. Note: When I uploaded this, the songs are appearing in the wrong order. It won't let me rename the numbers, sorry about that. Also Note: Charlie Miller has my master tapes and is working on it, so expect a major improvement in the future!","date":"1972-06-17T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd1972-06-17.shure-sony.melton.115839.flac16"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at Hollywood Bowl on 1972-06-17","description":"Set 1 Promised Land, Sugaree, Black Throated Wind, Tennessee Jed, Me & My Uncle, China Cat Sunflower-> I Know You Rider, Playin' In The Band, Loser, Beat It On Down The Line, Stella Blue, El Paso, Casey Jones Set 2 Big Railroad Blues, Jack Straw, Cumberland Blues, Truckin'-> Drums-> The Other One-> Ramble On Rose, Rockin' Pneumonia, Sugar Magnolia, You Win Again, Not Fade Away-> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-> Not Fade Away Pigpen's last show","date":"1972-06-17T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd1972-06-17.shure.melton.miller.116272.flac16"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at Hollywood Bowl on 1972-06-17","description":"Promised Land, Sugaree, Black Throated Wind, Tennessee Jed, Me & My Uncle, China Cat Sunflower-> I Know You Rider, Playin' In The Band, Loser, Beat It On Down The Line, Stella Blue, El Paso, Casey Jones Big Railroad Blues, Jack Straw, Cumberland Blues, Truckin'-> Drums-> The Other One-> Ramble On Rose, Rockin' Pneumonia, Sugar Magnolia, You Win Again, Not Fade Away-> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-> Not Fade Away","date":"1972-06-17T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd72-06-17.aud.hanno.16470.sbeok.shnf"},{"date":"1972-07-18T00:00:00Z","title":"Grateful Dead Live at Roosevelt Stadium on 1972-07-18","description":"Set 1 Bertha, Me & My Uncle, Bird Song, Promised Land, Sugaree, Black Throated Wind, China Cat Sunflower-> I Know You Rider, Jack Straw, Loser, Beat It On Set 2 Greatest Story Ever Told, Playin' In The Band, Brown Eyed Women, Tennessee Jed, Truckin'-> Dark Star-> Comes A Time Set 3 Sugar Magnolia, Ramble On Rose, Mississippi Half Step-> Sing Me Back Home, Not Fade Away-> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-> Not Fade Away, E: One More Saturday Night","identifier":"gd1972-07-18.127703.mtx.dusborne.flac16"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at Roosevelt Stadium on 1972-07-18","description":"Bertha, Me & My Uncle, Bird Song, Promised Land, Sugaree, Black Throated Wind, China Cat Sunflower-> I Know You Rider, Jack Straw, Loser, Beat It On Greatest Story Ever Told, Playin' In The Band, Brown Eyed Women, Tennessee Jed, Truckin'-> Dark Star-> Comes A Time Sugar Magnolia, Ramble On Rose, Mississippi Half Step-> Sing Me Back Home, Not Fade Away-> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-> Not Fade Away, E: One More Saturday Night","date":"1972-07-18T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd72-07-18.aud.weiner.5916.sbefail.shnf"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at Paramount Northwest Theater on 1972-07-22","description":"Set 1 Bertha, Me & My Uncle, You Win Again, Jack Straw, Bird Song, Beat It On Down The Line, Sugaree, Black Throated Wind, Big Railroad Blues, Cumberland Blues, Playin' In The Band, Brown Eyed Women, El Paso, Tennessee Jed Set 2 China Cat Sunflower-> I Know You Rider, Mexicali Blues, Deal, Promised Land, Stella Blue, Mississippi Half Step, Me And Bobby McGee, Ramble On Rose, Truckin'-> He's Gone, Sugar Magnolia, Morning Dew, Uncle John's Band, One More Saturday Night","date":"1972-07-22T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd1972-07-22.aud.jems.106930.flac16"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at San Jose Civic Auditorium on 1972-08-20","description":"disc 1: Set 1: Bertha Me & My Uncle Sugaree Beat It On Down The Line Bird Song Jack Straw Friend Of The Devil Black Throated Wind Cumberland Blues El Paso Loser Playin' In The Band disc 2: Set 2: Promised Land Brown Eyed Women Me And Bobby McGee He\\'s Gone disc 3: Tuning Truckin'-> Drums-> The Other One-> Stella Blue Sugar Magnolia Casey Jones-> One More Saturday Night E: Uncle John's Band","date":"1972-08-20T00:00:00Z","identifier":"gd1972-08-20.sony-schiappacasse.minches.82716.flac16"},{"title":"Grateful Dead Live at Folsom Field - University of Colorado on 1972-09-03","description":"Set 1 The Promised Land Sugaree Me And My Uncle Tennessee Jed Black Throated Wind Bird Song Beat It On Down The Line Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo Playing In The Band Casey Jones Set 2 Bertha El Paso Brown Eyed Women Mexicali Blues China Cat Sunflower -> I Know You Rider Truckin' Loser He's Gone -> The Other One -> Wharf Rat -> Johnny B.
